#  Advanced Programmable Countdown Timer

This timer was originally designed for UEA Triathlon Club, because the
exisiting solutions on the Internet are not greated. We used to use these two
timers:

1) https://www.online-stopwatch.com/interval-timer/
2) http://www.intervaltimer.com/create/hiit-timer

The problem with 1) is that using it involves a lot of mouse clicking,
which is just silly. The problem with 2) is that it is not very
customisable. At one point I wrote this:
3) https://github.com/fangfufu/make_interval_timer_video,
That is actually quite good, I used it to run all my sessions. The problem is
that you have to generate the video before session, which is also a bit
silly.

The web page is basically the HTML 5 solution to 3), I don't know about
whether the current cycling captain would use it, but if I am running a
turbo session, I would use it.

- server-side scripting.
